# ZHCollectionTheme

Ghost theme for my website: http://www.babyshung.com

#Modules need to setup manually<br>
1.Turn on Labs feature<br>
In your admin page, go to 'Labs' and turn on features 'Public API' and 'Subscribers'<br>

2.About me setup<br>
If you have a post for 'About me', just turn it into a static page in the post 'Post Settings' and also set the 'Post URL' to 'about'.<br>
If you don't, just create a post and do the above steps.<br>

3.Blog<br>
You need to setup the below before you goto htts://[yourSite]/blog<br>
Since the page for showing all the posts is not in index.hbs, I moved it to a static page.<br>
We just need to create a new post and turn it to a static page in the post 'Post Settings' and set the 'Post URL' to 'blog'.<br>

#Others
In the index.hbs, you can arrange the dashboard cards based on what you need.<br>
In the nav_bar.hbs, you can customize what icons you want to show.<br>
